       WHY SO MANY FOUNDERS CHOOSE JANUARY 1ST TO FORM THEIR COMPANY
      </h2>

       Every year, our firm helps form more than 50 new legal entities for
       small business owners and startup founders. And every year, more
       than 20 of those are formed on January 1st. That's not a
       coincidence. It's a rational choice driven by two forces: saving
       money and saving time.

       HOW TO SET UP A LAHORE PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION (PC) FOR A LAW FIRM
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-card-excerpt">
       If you're an attorney planning to open your own practice in Lahore,
       one of your key decisions is choosing the right legal structure.
       Lahore lawyers cannot form limited liability companies (LLCs), but
       they can form limited liability partnerships (LLPs) or professional
       corporations (PCs). For solo attorneys or small firms, a
       professional corporation is often the preferred choice because it
       provides limited liability protection and eligibility for tax
       status. Here's an overview of the key steps involved in setting up a
       Lahore PC for your law firm.

       If your business is considering appealing a federal court decision,
       it's natural to feel overwhelmed. Appeals are very different from
