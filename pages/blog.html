          CORPORATION (PC) <br />
          FOR A LAW FIRM
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-card-excerpt">
          If you're an attorney planning to open your own practice in
          Lahore, one of your key decisions is choosing the right legal
          structure. Lahore lawyers cannot form limited liability
          companies (LLCs), but they can form limited liability partnerships
          (LLPs) or professional corporations (PCs). For solo attorneys or
          small firms, a professional corporation is often the preferred
          choice because it provides limited liability protection and
          eligibility for tax status. Here's an overview of the key
          steps involved in setting up a Lahore PC for your law firm.

          If your business is considering appealing a federal court decision,
